# BIDS App for infant-abcd-hcp-pipeline

This is a "BIDS App" (a portable neuroimaging pipeline that understand BIDS
datasets). This software takes a BIDS folder as input, determines parameters to
be used, and runs the [dcan lab's modified hcp pipeline for
infants](https://github.com/DCAN-Labs/dcan-infant-pipeline.git).

### Installation
In order to run this software via a container, you will need to acquire a copy
of the FreeSurfer License for yourself.

[Follow this link for a FreeSurfer
License](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/License)

### Usage:

Before running, you will need to load the image onto your Docker service by
running the following command:

```{bash}
docker pull dcanlabs/infant-abcd-hcp-pipeline
```

If you receive a "no space left on device" error during this pull process,
you may need to clean up any old/dangling images and containers from the docker
registry, and possibly increase the amount of space allocated to Docker.

To call the Docker image:

```{bash}
docker run --rm \
    -v <path to bids_dataset>:/bids_input:ro \
    -v <path to outputs>:/output \
    -v <path to freesurfer license.txt>:/opt/freesurfer/license.txt  \
    dcanlabs/infant-abcd-bids-pipeline /bids_input /output [OPTIONS]
```

              bids_dir output_dir

The Developmental Cognition and Neuroimaging (DCAN) lab fMRI Pipeline [1].
This BIDS application initiates a functional MRI processing pipeline built
upon the Human Connectome Project's minimal processing pipelines [2].  The
application requires only a dataset conformed to the BIDS specification, and
little-to-no additional configuration on the part of the user. BIDS format
and applications are explained in detail at http://bids.neuroimaging.io/

positional arguments:
  bids_dir              path to the input bids dataset root directory. Read
                        more about bids format in the link in the description.
                        It is recommended to use the dcan bids gui or dcm2bids
                        to convert from participant dicoms to bids.
  output_dir            path to the output directory for all intermediate and
                        output files from the pipeline, also path in which
                        logs are stored.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --aseg PATH           specify path to the aseg file to be used by
                        FreeSurfer. Default: aseg generated by PreFreeSurfer.
  --atropos-mask-method {REFINE,CREATE,NONE}
                        We create a mask (T1w_acpc_brain_mask.nii.gz) near the
                        top of PreFreeSurfer. Later, we refine the mask using
                        atropos. In some cases we just want to use the mask
                        that atropos creates during the refinement step to
                        overwrite the original mask. To do that, set this
                        option to CREATE. Other times, we may want to keep the
                        mask as-is, in which case, use NONE. Tip: for neos,
                        use REFINE; for older babies (8+?) use CREATE.
                        Default: REFINE.
  --atropos-range LOWER UPPER
                        range to be used for atropos labeling. Defaults: 4 and
                        5.
  --bandstop LOWER UPPER
                        parameters for motion regressor band-stop filter. It
                        is recommended for the boundaries to match the inter-
                        quartile range for participant group respiratory rate
                        (bpm), or to match bids physio data directly [3].
                        These parameters are highly recommended for data
                        acquired with a frequency of approx. 1 Hz or more
                        (TR<=1.0). Default: no filter
  --dcmethod {TOPUP,FIELDMAP,T2_DC,NONE}
                        specify a distortion correction method. Default: use
                        auto-detection.
  --freesurfer-license PATH
                        If using docker or singularity, you will need to
                        acquire and provide your own FreeSurfer license. The
                        license can be acquired by filling out this form:
                        https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/registration.html
  --hyper-normalization-method {ADULT_GM_IP,ROI_IPS,NONE}
                        specify the intensity profiles to use for the hyper-
                        normalization step in FreeSurfer: ADULT_GM_IP adjusts
                        the entire base image such that the IP of GM in the
                        target roughly matches the IP of GM of the reference
                        (i.e., the adult freesurfer atlas). Then the WM is
                        shifted in the target image to match the histogram of
                        WM in the reference. ROI_IPS adjusts the intensity
                        profiles of each ROI (GM, WM, CSF) separately and
                        reassembles the parts. NONE skips hyper-normalization
                        step. This allows the user to run PreFreeSurfer, apply
                        new, experimental hyper-normalization methods and then
                        restart at FreeSurfer. Default: ADULT_GM_IP.
  --jlf-method {T1W,T2W,T1W_ORIG}
                        specify method to use to perform joint label fusion
                        Default: T1W.
  --max-cortical-thickness MM
                        maximum cortical thickness to allow in FreeSurfer.
                        Default: 5 mm.
  --motion-control-frame FRAME, --mc-frame FRAME
                        frame to be used when computing motion-control values.
                        This choosing different frames to see what works best
                        for a run. In future, will add an algorithm to
                        determine best frame(s). Default: 17
  --multi-masking-dir PATH
                        directory for joint label fusion masks.
  --multi-template-dir PATH
                        directory for joint label fusion templates. It should
                        contain only folders which each contain a
                        "T1w_brain.nii.gz" and a "Segmentation.nii.gz". Each
                        subdirectory may have any name and any number of
                        additional files.
  --no-crop             alignment in PreFreeSurfer does neck/shoulder
                        cropping. Some images do not have neck and shoulders,
                        so do not want this cropping to happen. This option
                        allows user to turn that off.
  --participant-label LABEL [LABEL ...]
                        optional list of participant ids to run. Default is
                        all ids found under the bids input directory. A
                        participant label does not include "sub-"
  --session-id [LABEL [LABEL ...]]
                        filter input dataset by session id. Default is all ids
                        found under the subject input directory(s). A session
                        id does not include "ses-"
  --smoothing-iterations ITERATIONS
                        Tell FreeSurfer how many smoothing iterations to run.
                        Default: 10 iterations.
  --subcortical-map-method {ROI_MAP,MNI_AFFINE}
                        specify method to use to align subcorticals. Default:
                        ROI_MAP.
  --T1-brain-mask PATH  specify the path to the mask file. The file specified
                        must be aligned with the T1w image. The mask will
                        first be copied into the T1w folder as
                        T1w_brain_mask.nii.gz. It will then be ACPC aligned,
                        using the matrix generated when aligning the T1w
                        image. The result will be written to
                        T1w/T1w_acpc_brain_mask.nii.gz. Tip: when supplying a
                        brain-mask, you may want to set --atropos-mask-method
                        to NONE. Default: mask generated by PreFreeSurfer.
  --t1-study-template HEAD BRAIN
                        T1w template head and brain images for intermediate
                        nonlinear registration, effective where population
                        differs greatly from average adult, e.g. in elderly
                        populations with large ventricles.
  --t2-study-template HEAD BRAIN
                        T2w template head and brain images for intermediate
                        nonlinear registration, effective where population
                        differs greatly from average adult, e.g. in elderly
                        populations with large ventricles.

special pipeline options:
  options which pertain to an alternative pipeline or an extra stage.

  --anat-only, --ignore-func
                        Ignore functional files (process anatomy files only).
                        This option must be set in order to process subjects
                        for which no functional data was collected.
  --custom-clean PATH   runs dcan cleaning script after the pipeline completes
                        successfully, to delete pipeline outputs based on the
                        file structure specified in the custom-clean json.
  --file-mapper-json PATH
                        runs dcan file-mapper after the pipeline completes
                        successfully, to copy pipeline outputs to BIDS-
                        formatted derivatives files based on the file-mapper
                        json.

runtime options:
  Run-time instructions. These options are not passed to the stages. Rather, they control what and how the pipeline is run.

  --check-outputs-only  checks for the existence of outputs for each stage
                        then exit. Useful for debugging.
  --ignore-expected-outputs
                        continues pipeline even if some expected outputs are
                        missing.
  --ncpus NCPUS         number of cores to use for concurrent processing and
                        algorithmic speedups. Warning: causes ANTs and
                        FreeSurfer to produce non-deterministic results.
                        Default: 1.
  --print-commands-only
                        print run commands for each stage to shell then exit.
  --stage STAGE, --stages STAGE
                        specify a subset of stages to run.If a single stage
                        name is given, the pipeline with be started at that
                        stage. If a string with a ":" is given, a stage name
                        before the ":" will tell run.py where to start and a
                        stage name after the ":" will tell it where to stop.
                        If no ":" is found, the pipeline will start with the
                        stage specified and run to the end. Calling run.py
                        with: --stage="PreFreeSurfer:PreFreeSurfer" or with:
                        --stage=":PreFreeSurfer" will cause only PreFreeSurfer
                        to be run. (This can be useful to do optional
                        processing betweenPreFreeSurfer and
                        FreeSurfer.)Calling run.py with:
                        --stages="FreeSurfer:FMRISurface" will start with
                        stage FreeSurfer and stop afterFMRISurface (before
                        DCANBOLDProcessing).Default start is PreFreeSurfer and
                        default stop is ExecutiveSummary. The specifications:
                        --stages="PreFreeSurfer:ExecutiveSummary"
                        --stages=":ExecutiveSummary" --stages="PreFreeSurfer:"
                        are exactly identical to each other and to sending no
                        --stage argument. Valid stage names: PreFreeSurfer,
                        FreeSurfer, PostFreeSurfer, FMRIVolume, FMRISurface,
                        DCANBOLDProcessing, ExecutiveSummary
  --version, -v         show program's version number and exit

#### Examples

Running all subjects from a BIDS dataset:

```{bash}
docker run --rm \
    -v <path to bids_dataset>:/bids_input:ro \
    -v <path to outputs>:/output \
    -v <path to freesurfer license.txt>:/opt/freesurfer/license.txt  \
    dcanlabs/infant-abcd-bids-pipeline /bids_input /output
```

Running a single subject from the dataset:

```{bash}
docker run --rm \
    -v <path to bids_dataset>:/bids_input:ro \
    -v <path to outputs>:/output \
    -v <path to freesurfer license.txt>:/opt/freesurfer/license.txt  \
    dcanlabs/infant-abcd-bids-pipeline /bids_input /output --participant-label <label>
```

Running with different templates:

Babies of different ages require different templates. The templates included in
the Docker image are for neonates (0-2 months). To use different templates, just
mount them to the location at which the pileline expects them:

```{bash}
docker run --rm \
    -v <path to bids_dataset>:/bids_input:ro \
    -v <path to outputs>:/output \
    -v <path to freesurfer license.txt>:/opt/freesurfer/license.txt  \
    -v <path to baby_templates folder>:/opt/pipeline/global/templates
    dcanlabs/infant-abcd-bids-pipeline /bids_input /output
```

Note that the mount flag "-v" follows "docker run", as it is a docker option,
whereas the "--participant-label" flag follows "infant-abcd-bids-pipeline", as
it is an option passed into this pipeline.

### Additional Information:

#### Outputs

The outputs are organized in the following structure:
```
.
└── sub-<id>
    └── ses-<id>
        ├── files
        │   ├── ...
        │   ├── MNINonLinear
        │   ├── ses-<id>_task-rest_run-01
        │   ├── ses-<id>_task-rest_run-02
        │   ├── summary_DCANBOLDProc
        │   ├── T1w
        │   ├── T2w
        │   └── ...
        └── logs
            ├── DCANBOLDProcessing

            ├── FreeSurfer
            ├── PostFreeSurfer
            └── PreFreeSurfer

```

##### files
- MNINonLinear: contains the final space results of anatomy in 164k resolution.
- MNINonLinear/Results: final space functional data.
- MNINonLinear/fsaverage_32K: final space anatomy in 32k resolution, where functional data is ultimately projected.
- ses-<id>_task-<name>_run-<num>: these folders contain intermediate functional preprocessing files.
- summary_DCANBOLDProc/executive_summary: the .html file within can be opened for quality inspection of pipeline results.
- T1w and T2w: contain native space anatomical data as well as intermediate preprocessing files.
- T1w/<id>: The participant ID folder within T1w is the FreeSurfer subject folder.

##### logs
The logs folder contains a folder of log files for each stage. In the case of an
error consult these files *in addition to* the standard err/out of the pipeline
itself.

###### status.json codes:

- unchecked: 999
- succeeded: 1
- incomplete: 2
- failed: 3
- not started: 4


#### Rerunning
The --stage option exists so you can restart the pipeline in the case that
it terminated prematurely. The name of the stage will correspond exactly (in
spelling and in case) to the name of the logs folder for the stage that failed.

**NOTE** Not all arguments are used in all stages. For example, the bandstop
min and max values are used for motion correction in the DCANBOLDProcessing
stage, but not in any others. So, if you re-start the pipeline from
ExectiveSummary with different bandstop values, the output will not change. Or
if you run the pipeline multiple times with --anat-only, using different
bandstop values will not change any results, since --anat-only runs only
PreFreeSurfer, FreeSurfer, and PostFreeSurfer (anatomy) stages.

#### Misc.
The pipeline may take over 36 hours if using too few cores. Most fMRI processing
can be done in parallel. It is recommended to use 10 cores and allow for at
least 4 GB of memory per core to be safe.
